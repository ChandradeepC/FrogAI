Is it as good as neo g7/8 from picture quality

Hello, I hope to find some answer because I am struggling to find something that I like. I have been looking for a monitor and reading the google doc but I still canâ€™t find what I am looking for. I mainly play Valorant, watching YouTube / Netflix and some Microsoft Word for my school. I was looking for a 1440p 240hz but with a good contrast ratio and the least backlight bleed / glowing since I am playing with a desk lamp facing my wall (so my room is not dark and not bright, just between). Iâ€™ve seen that LG / ASUS have recently released their OLED panels, but the 200cd/m2 seems to be a bit to dim for me. Do you have some google alternatives that would be great for what I am mainly looking for ? (Good contrast / black / response time / input lag) Thanks in advance for the help.
(Right now Iâ€™ve seen those : Gigabyte M27Q-X / Alienware aw2723df / MSI MAG274QRX but it seems that they have a lot of bleeding)

What's the best 240hz monitor I can buy that's cheap

Should I get the Gigabyte M27Q P or Samsung Odyssey G7?

Is the LG GQ950-b any good?

Here are the monitors Iâ€™ve tried in the last month. XL2566K - Best competitive monitor.  Sucks at everything else. PG27AQN- Good for competitive. Not great below 240hz, good for office. Hate the coating on the screen. AW3423DWF- not as good as the other two for competitive, not amazing for office work, great coating, scared of burn in. Amazing HDR.
LG Oled- 2nd best for competitive, not great HDR. Brightness is not great. Not great for office work and scared of burn.

24inch or a little more, 1920x1080, IPS, minimum 144hz - max ??, 150 to 300$, gaming-movies-work, PC USE 1080ti nvidia gpu, perfect colors, great brightness, good blacks(i really care about blacks), 1 ms, no ghosting etc. EU-swe

Looking to upgrade my Zowie XL2411-B( it had a lot of problems out of the box and more over-time) to IPS-display with better everything: budget is 150$ to 300$. Any suggesitons? 

Hey all,
Looking for a display for programming. Will be connected to a laptop
Budget : 12,000 INR
Location India
I have shortlisted the following displays but can't seem to figure out the difference between them
- lf24t352fhwxxl
- ls24r358fzwxxl
- lf24t350fhwxxl

Hey all, looking for some help upgrading to an ultrawide. The budget is $1300 before tax & I'm in the US. I've been looking at the LG 38GN950-B.AUS. I had recently purchased the AW3423DWF but had a bunch of weird issues that I decided to return it and look for something else. Thoughts on the LG above?

is it really worth it to go from 1440p 165hz (LG 27GP850-B) to 4k 120hz (LG C2) for gaming? im currently running a 2080Super on 1440p and im going to get a 7900 xtx in a couple of weeks, so i'd go from 2080S on 1440p to 7900xtx on 4k, i'd end up having a bit less fps performance but on higher resolution but idk if it's worth it, i could stay on 1440p and blast every setting to ultra on the 7900xtx or stick to high setting on 4k and stick to 100fps mostly i doubt there would be any noticeable difference in performance to what im currently playing at, but visual quality should improve by a lot, so that's my dilema

Hello! Anyone know if the AW3423DWF is definitely worth the extra 600$ over the LG 34GN83A-B? I'll use the monitor for design and gaming. Text need to be sharp, color range must be wide. I tried the LG for a while and was very happy with it, I'm wondering if I'll be happier with the Alienware!

AW2723DF or Omen X 27 for CSGO/Overwatch (and some other SP games)?

Hello I'm sorry if I'm absolutely clueless, im searching for a monitor with good colors basically. More specifically I was gifted an ipad pro for christmas and have been blown away by how colorful and bright everything looks on it, my monitor by comparison looks drab and colorless. Is there some particular term for what I'm looking for? Resolution im going for is 1440p (2k) and plan to use it for just about everything, gaming, drawing, viewing media, productivity. Is there a specific category I should be looking into? Someone pointed me to the Asus ProArt displays but I'm skeptical to just go for that since so many other monitors seem to claim similar specs

Does anyone here have a monitor recommendation for a mix of 1080 and 1440 gaming? I don't know what would be good for a good mix of size and pixel density. Looking to spend $350-400 or less

Hi looking for a 27" 1440p 240hz monitor mainly for CSGO and Overwatch but also a variety of other games. Been scouring reviews for weeks now and main ones that stuck out were AW2723DF (~Â£520), M27Q-X (~Â£560 so not as much of a deal in the UK) and Omen X 27 (Â£~450 but TN so not sure about contrast). Anyone have any recommendations for this use case? Or what sort of response time/overshoot is acceptable for more competitive FPS's? As I can see which are better or worse in numbers but no real context of how much difference that makes 

Gigabyte M27Q P or AOC Agon AG274QXM? I am looking for a good 1440p IPS monitor and these are the best two options i found (in my country anyway). The gigabyte is roughly $30 more expensive though I would be willing to pay for it if it's significantly better since I know a lot of people love that monitor. What do you guys think?

should i get a AOC Q27G2S/D or a Titan Army 32A2QR

is there any monitors that are 144hz or more with 1440p and is 24"?

Hi, I am looking for a 4k monitor with at least 144Hz and a decent size.
I am mostly coding and playing games(which I'd do at 1080p/2k for performance) but need as much space as possible so that I can preview the thing I am working on/have multiple apps/tabs open at the same time.
I currently have an Asus ROG Strix xg258q and it's nowhere big enough/doesn't have enough pixels for my needs.
So far, the best monitor I've found is a Samsung Odyssey Neo G7/G8 but I am open to your suggestions.

Is there any difference between the Dell S2721DGF and the Dell S2722DGFA? Itâ€™s just a new batch, right?

Looking for a monitor for photo and video editing must be at minimum 4k and preferably hdr600 or better as well as a Delta E of less than 2 any suggestions? Iâ€™ve been considering something from the Asus pro art line / also josh to a gaming monitor if itâ€™s got a low enough DE and a wide enough color gamut.

guys, is the new BenQ EX240 comparable to the EX2510? I don't see it in the top 1080p list

Is there any difference between OLED42C26LB and OLED42C2PUA

is samsung neo g8 bad?

looking for advice on finding a 24-25in, 1440p, ips, high refresh rate gaming monitor
I dont care how much it costs
does this not exist ðŸ˜¦
I DO NOT WANT A 27in I dont like playing on them
will take a 1080p monitor with really really good color

Looking for a:
Resolution + Refresh Rate:
ultrawide 1440p and above + 144hz refresh rate and above 
Using it for (Gaming, Work, etc) on PC/PS5 etc (State Graphics Card)
60% gaming, 40% work (spreadsheets, email, online tools) on a PC (NVIDIA RTX 3080)
Size
Currently looking at 38" ultrawide ("upgrading" from a Samsung G7)
Country
Malaysia
Budget
SGD 2,000 or MYR 6,000 (can extend a bit, but not much).
Anything Else (Want Specific Brightness, VESA Mounting, etc.)
Further requirements: VESA mount is MANDATORY
Currently in a toss up between the Dell Alienware AW3821DW vs LG 38GN950-B. Both are realistically within my budget, but I can't fathom the difference between the two sufficiently to make an informed decision. 
For my gaming usage case, I would like to play games at high refresh rates using the ultrawide format. Mainly playing Lost Ark right now, but will be back to playing other games as they release (waiting for Hogwarts to stabilize). 
For work usage case, a lot of spreadsheets. Actually I also use spreadsheets for gaming (yes, I am a min-maxer). 
Lastly, I do not need this urgently, so if something more suitable is going to be released to the public within the next 3 months, I am more than willing to wait.

I need help choosing between two high-end monitors: The Samsung Odyssey G7 Neo 32 inch for 1200$ or the LG 32GQ850-B (4K 165hz) for 850$ (1440p 240hz). I am coding for most of the day, but I like to play games too. The most important factor for me  is the image quality (colors and contrast). According to a lot of reviewers, the G7 is the best non-OLED panel for image quality, but I am a little skeptical about the curve. Is there a big image quality difference? Has anyone used both these displays? And is the curve on the G7 really that bad? I have used curved ultrawide before, but not a monitor which is curved to this degree. I'm also totally okay with spending the extra money if there is a big difference between the G7 and LG. I'm currently rocking an RTX 4090 paired with a 13900K.
