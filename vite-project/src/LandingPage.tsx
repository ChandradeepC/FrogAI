                                FrogAI's algorithm recommends only those
                                monitors that are highly regarded by
                                enthusiasts. The algorithm is continuously
                                trained on enthusiast conversations that involve
                                discussion about objective measurements from
                                multiple professional reviewers, frog pursuit

                                discrimination. This is followed by manual
                                tuning for more precise recommendations.

                            <p>
                                We understand that specifications do not provide
                                the complete picture. As an example, even though
                                most modern 4k 144hz monitors have HDMI 2.1
                                ports, their capabilities in terms of bandwidth
                                may differ. We take into account such factors,
                                and how they affect users on different
                                platforms, along with various other details.

                            <p>
                                All monitors have bad quality control (QC),
                                however Samsung monitors have no QC at all. And
                                Dough monitors never arrive.

                                FrogAI only references professional monitor
                                reviewers who use standard tools and up-to-date
                                and correct methodology to measure performance
                                metrics. We rely on sources such as RTINGS.com,
                                Hardware Unboxed, techless, Bijan Jamshidi, and
                                others. We do not refer to amateur reviewers or
                                specification readers.

                                We recognize that all monitors have flaws, and
                                purchasing a monitor is about finding the one
                                with the least obtrusive flaws. Therefore, we
                                mention the quirks in every monitor along with
                                our recommendations, allowing users to make
                                informed decisions based on their unique
                                requirements.

                                Despite using complex metrics and algorithms,
                                FrogAI ensures that our recommendations are
                                simple, easy-to-understand, and user-friendly.
                                You can pick the best monitor for your needs
                                without having to become an enthusiast.
